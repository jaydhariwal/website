<title>About myself</title>

<!--This is a section describing yourself and your prototyping related interests and projects and anything else that you would like.-->
<h2>My background</h2>
<p>My undergrad was in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Guwahati in India. I did my Masters from Purdue University, USA in Industrial Engineering and then worked for 4 years as an Operations Research Analyst in United States Coastguard. After that, I did my PhD from IIT Bombay, India on energy efficient building design. During my 1st Postdoc from MIT, Cambridge, USA, I extended my work from building to urban scale to the design of outdoor public spaces for thermal comfort using urban microclimate modelling and big data analytics of Wi-Fi data as a proxy to occupant behavior. While I was at MIT, I got very interested in &ldquo;How to make almost anything?&rdquo; philosophy. My interests in &ldquo;making&rdquo; got me to my next Postdoc to work on medical device development in the University of Leeds, UK.</p>

<h2>Previous work</h2>
<p>I am sharing details about my previous research and hobbyist projects in making.</p>

<h3>Medical device development</h3>

<p>This research is about design and fabrication of an automated spray medical device &ldquo;ChromoSpray&rdquo; to improve chromo endoscopic surveillance for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). I was a Postdoc at Dept. of Mech. Engg., University of Leeds, UK from Jan 2018 till Jan 2019 for carrying out this work.</p>
